## 📰 News
- **2026.02.25:** Initial release of LFD code on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/18772173).

## ✨ Introduction
LFD is a latent-compression-free generative diffusion framework for implicit structural modeling.  
It generates structural models directly in data space, enabling explicit geological constraints and
geophysical regularization during generation, while supporting efficient large-patch Vision Transformer inference.
